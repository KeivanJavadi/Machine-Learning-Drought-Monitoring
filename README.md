# Machine-Learning-Drought-Monitoring
The Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) is a drought monitoring index that quantifies drought conditions by considering both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration.  In this repository the effects of various climate variables on SPEI is assessed by Machine Learning Regression trees.
